# pareto #tax #redistribution #rich #poor #capitalism #monopoly
A model based on the Pareto distribution, to approximate capitalism, including redistribution (tax).

The Pareto distribution explains that resources accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer people; think of the game, Monopoly. The endpoint is one player having everything, and everybody else having nothing.

In the program, three players begin with 1000 coins. Two players are picked randomly, and if they are different players, a coin toss takes place. The loser gives the winner 10 coins. This continues until one player has everything, and everyone else has nothing.

To make it more interesting, lists are used to load the probability of winning the toss in the richer player's favour (as in real life, making money is much easier when you have some).

I have included a redistribution mechanism too, that takes money from the rich and gives it to the poor. By altering the probability of winning, and altering the amount of redistribution, games can be over quickly, or they can take millions of turns, and in probability, never end.
